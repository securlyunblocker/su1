# Securly Unblocker 1
## securly unblocker and hapara unblocker, unblock any site!
This is not to be mistaken with SU4 or SU5 (also known as the Bypass Tool), as the founders of both have joined together to make this tool, which combines their scripts (credits to the creators of the scripts) and a complete rewrite of the GUIs, functionalities, and future expansion windows, we present to you, the SU1 Tool.

## What can I do with this tool?

Well, to start off, unblock securly (I mean, its literally in the name). Aside from that, games, random misc tools, proxies, and unblockers are already present, and even thoguh this is the first beta release (4/4/2022), we have many features, and a practical game hub for anyone who wants to use it. Currently access is free, however in the future, as we grow expanentially, we may start using a small amount of ads. 

## How do I get it?

Please make a bookmark containing this code:

javascript:(function()%7Bconst loadScript %3D async(url) %3D> %7B%0A    const response %3D await fetch(url)%0A    const script %3D await response.text()%0A    eval(script)%0A%7D%0A%0Aconst scriptUrl %3D "https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fsecurlyunblocker%2FSU1%2Fmain%2Fmain.js"%0AloadScript(scriptUrl)%7D)()%3B

## Some games/features are not working!!!

Keep in mind that this is completely in beta right now, and currently, you can either use a proxy or the securly unblocker to unblock features. If it is getting blocked by another system, and you have an unblocker for it, feel free to email [securlyunblocker@gmail.com](mailto:securlyunblocker@gmail.com). 

## I HATE CONTENT KEEPER!!!

Me too. However, I do not have any unblockers for it other than proxies, but if those are blocked, I have no idea how to unblock it. I will add more proxies in the future though. If you have an unblocker for Content Keeper, please email me at [securlyunblocker@gmail.com](mailto:securlyunblocker@gmail.com), and I will try to add your suggestions as soon as possible.

## THIS IS IN BETA!!!

Some features may not work, and there may be exploits, so feel free to contact [securlyunblocker@gmail.com](mailto:securlyunblocker@gmail.com) for any support you need or issues you found.
